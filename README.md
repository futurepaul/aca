#Hey!

This project doesn't really "work" yet, but it does stuff.

`git clone` it, then `npm install`, then `npm run dev`

Fire up localhost:8080 in a browser, good friend

I put all the stuff you can do in really cool buttons on the top! "start" starts recording (observes cursor events and puts them in an object), "stop" stops recording. "store" puts that recording into localstorage, "populate" pulls it back out in case you refresh your browser. "play" plays through a set of events. If you push play in soundcloud, and you have some events loaded up, they should play more or less in sync. Everything else is messed up and you'll probably die if you try any of this.
